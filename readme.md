# Forum Demos

As you all know, the real knowledge transfer and fun happens outside of the big halls, where people have a drink, share stories and discuss the things they just saw.
And well, if a certain nerd wants to brag about his toys and do an impromptu demo, who is to say him "no"? :)

In this repository you can find the materials for the short - and unrecorded - demos about ...

+ [Migrating AzureAD and MSOnline to MSGraph](https://github.com/FriedrichWeinmann/PSAzureMigrationAdvisor) (or at least how to get some actionable guidance for that. The old modules are being deprecated so the clock is ticking ...)
+ [Getting some powerful logging in PowerShell](https://psframework.org/documentation/documents/psframework/logging.html) (who wants to reinvent Write-Log for the hundredth time?)
